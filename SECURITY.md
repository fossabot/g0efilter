# Security

This is a personal open-source project maintained in spare time — best effort only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report issues **privately** via GitHub:
- Repo -> **Security** -> **Report a vulnerability** (Security Advisories).
- Include steps to reproduce, affected commit/branch, impact, and any suggested fixes.
- Please don’t open public issues or PRs with exploit details.

## Disclosure
Kindly give me a chance to look into it before discussing anything publicly.  
There are **no SLAs or guarantees** — I’ll respond and fix things as time permits.

Thanks for helping keep things safe.
